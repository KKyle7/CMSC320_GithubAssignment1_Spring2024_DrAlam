Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I beleve data science is the best way ti combine my interests: computer science, statistics, and medicine. Contrary to software engineering, data science is an interdisciplinary field that allows one to blend multiple fields. It's the closest humans can get to "predicting the future" as we are now in an age where with enough data, almost anything can be analyzed and possbly predicted. There is not shortage of data in the world, so there is a always more to learn and do. CMSC320 is the first introduction to data science, so in order to learn more about the field, I am very interested in taking CMSC320.
